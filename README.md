## Machines
A module that provides the infrastructure to easily make machines for processing or assembly of materials.

### Processes
Definitions of inputs and outputs. In a most basic form,  could take in blocks and output a variant of that block. In more complex scenarios, could input blocks, energy, and tools and output a different block.

### Machine GUI
Interactable blocks can hook in to a dynamic UI that handles the schematic input, output, and requirements.  Or... roll your own.
